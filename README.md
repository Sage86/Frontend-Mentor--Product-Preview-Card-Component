## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
What I've learnt:
- Learning to code has changed my way of thinking and problem-solving
- I wouldn't have described myself as super analytical, but the practice of FE has encouraged this trait to grow
- I've also had to realise that I won't be able to remember everything I code after a day of doing it, it will take constant practice

### Continued development
- I want to make my code cleaner
- I want to increase the speed it would take for me to do this challenge next time
- In time, I would like to incorporate JavaScript (once I master it), and add greater dynamism to the challenge
- I'm very excited to eventually develop all the screens I have designed in Figma (personal projects)


### Useful resources
- [W3 Schools] (https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with learning new things in CSS because I was being introduced to new styling in this challenge.
- [Stack Overflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/) - This site was relatively new to me, but a great usefull find nonetheless.
